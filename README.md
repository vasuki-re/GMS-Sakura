# GMS Sakura

A minimal fork of GhostGMS that disables unnecessary GMS services and added fallback shell script creation to enable/disable services.

## Features ðŸŒ¸

- Disables unnecessary GMS services
- Custom shell script generation based on preferences (Enable/Disable)
- Select specific services during module installation

## Installation

1. Install module via Magisk/KSU
2. Select desired GMS services during installation
3. Reboot and forget :)

## Note

Make sure to create a shell script during module installation to help re-enable disabled services if something breaks.
